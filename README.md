**Co-Founder & CTO** at [Always Friday](https://alwaysfriday.it)

Building the first humanless event agency, an AI-native platform that autonomously plans and executes corporate events from start to finish. As CTO of a 13-person company, I drive the technical vision behind our AI-based products serving 100+ customers.

## About Always Friday

At Always Friday, we're building the first humanless event agency. Our AI-native platform autonomously handles every aspect of corporate event planning and execution, from initial concept and vendor coordination to on-site management and post-event analysis. What traditionally required human event planners working for weeks is now done by our LLM-powered agents operating 24/7.

**Key Milestones:**
- Raised €700K in pre-seed funding
- Scaled to a team of 13 across engineering, product, sales, and operations
- Serving 100+ customers across Europe with our autonomous event planning platform
- Built proprietary LLM architecture that autonomously manages end-to-end event workflows

As CTO, I lead our technical strategy, architecture decisions, and engineering culture, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with autonomous AI agents while maintaining production-grade reliability.
